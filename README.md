## Self Introduction
Hi! I'm Grace Alto, a sophomore at Lehigh University studying Journalism and Theatre from Warren, NJ.

I currently work as a TikTok Intern for the Lehigh Office of Admissions, a Social Media, Marketing and Communications Assistant at the Lehigh Office of Sustainability, and as a Sales Associate at the Sterling Hallmark. In the Summer of 2024, I will be working as a Social Media Intern for the IEEE Standards Association in Piscataway, NJ. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy writing (more specifically screenwriting and fiction writing), learning French and Italian, sewing, golf, going down the shore to Cape May, NJ and watching Formula 1 grand prixs.
