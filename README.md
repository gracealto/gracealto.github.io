## Self Introduction
Hi! I'm Grace Alto, a sophomore at Lehigh University studying Journalism and Theatre from Warren, NJ.

I currently work as a TikTok Intern for the Lehigh Office of Admissions, a Social Media, Marketing and Communications Assistant at the Lehigh Office of Sustainability, and as a Sales Associate at the Sterling Hallmark. In the Summer of 2024, I will be working as a Social Media Intern for the IEEE Standards Association in Piscataway, NJ. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy writing (more specifically screenwriting and fiction writing), learning French and Italian, sewing, golf, going down the shore to Cape May, NJ and watching Formula 1 grand prixs.

The data below is only for Formula 1 Grand Prixs that has a price increase between 2023 and 2024. Grand Prixs that [F1Destinations](https://f1destinations.com) did not have data on for 2024, and Grand Prixs that had a decrease in ticket price were excluded. 

Grand Prixs that did not have a change in price were, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. 

Grand Prixs that had a decrease in ticket price were, Emiglia-Romagna (Imola) and Italy (Monza). 

The Chinese Grand Prix was excluded because it did not take place in 2023 so there is no difference to record. 

At the time of writing and publishing their article, [F1Destinations](https://f1destinations.com) did not have any data on ticket prices for Miami, Azerbaijan, USA (COTA, Austin), Las Vegas, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.
